# Freepath

### An information network that lives in your pocket

### and spreads through human contact.

---

## The problem

We live in a world saturated with content — yet getting worse at evaluating it.

- Algorithms decide what reaches us, optimizing for **reaction** over **reflection**
- A single platform mediates what billions of people see
- Filtering is centralized, opaque, and detached from the communities it affects

> When a company controls the pipe, they control the message.

---

## The idea

Freepath is an information network that requires **no internet, no servers, and no central authority**.

Instead of routing messages through a data center, it works the way stories and letters worked for thousands of years:

> **person to person, device to device**

When two phones running Freepath come near each other, they automatically and silently exchange content.

**Your phone becomes a node. You become the infrastructure.**

---

## How it works

Think of it like seeds carried by the wind — except the wind is people going about their lives.

1. You write a post. Your phone stores it.
2. You walk past someone else using Freepath.
3. Your phones notice each other and exchange what each is missing.
4. That person moves on. The post keeps spreading.

This is called **Store, Carry, Forward** — a delay-tolerant model where information travels at the pace of human
movement.

No algorithm decides otherwise. No company can deplatform you from a network that has no platform.

---

## You control what you share

Nothing is exchanged without your consent. You choose the strategy:

- **Starred** — only content you've explicitly marked to propagate
- **Last N posts** — a rolling window of your most recent activity
- **Everything** — your full local store, for active carriers
- **Something else entirely** — the model is open

Propagation is decentralized. What travels, travels because **people chose to carry it** — not because an algorithm
decided so.

---

## Privacy and trust

- **No account, no email, no phone number.** Your identity is a cryptographic keypair generated on your device.
- **Every piece of content is signed.** You can always tell if two posts came from the same author — without knowing who
  they are.
- **Private messages are end-to-end encrypted**, even as they physically travel through other people's devices.
- **Trust is local.** You decide who you trust. No shadowbans, no global reputation system.

---

## Hubs

Beyond individual devices, **hubs** are fixed nodes placed in physical spaces — always on, always broadcasting.

- A cafeteria, a bookshop, a university library, a public square
- You walk in, open the app, and collect what the hub has to offer
- Content can be **public** or **encrypted** — controlled by the owner of the space
- Hubs can even serve as **community voting points** — polling people as they pass through

Hubs create a layer of physical distribution points: informal, decentralized, and rooted in real places.

## Where it could work

| Community              | Outdoors            | Crisis            |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| University campuses    | Hiking trails       | Refugee camps     |
| Schools & libraries    | Sailing communities | Disaster response |
| Bookshops & cafes      | Music festivals     | Protest movements |
| Neighbourhood networks | Markets & fairs     | Independent press |

Wherever people move, the network can follow.

---

## Why this matters

- **No cold start** — it begins the moment two devices meet
- **No infrastructure costs** — runs on hardware people already own
- **No surveillance at scale** — content is fragmented across thousands of devices
- **Deletion means something** — what you remove is gone, unless someone brings it back
- **Slowness is a feature** — what spreads is what people found worth carrying

> A network where strangers carry each other's words — not because an algorithm surfaced it, but because a person
> decided it was worth bringing along.

## Where we are

Freepath is currently **an idea**.

- No code yet
- No technical design yet
- This repository exists to share the concept and collect opinions

**We are looking for:**

- People who find this idea worth building
- Experience in mobile development, cryptography, Bluetooth networking, distributed systems
- Thoughts, criticism, and alternative perspectives
